# Config Schemas

These are configuration schemas extracted from canonical upstreams:

- [bash-language-server](https://github.com/mads-hartmann/bash-language-server/blob/master/vscode-client/package.json)
- [pyls](https://github.com/palantir/python-language-server/blob/develop/vscode-client/package.json)
- [dockerfile-language-server-nodejs](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/blob/master/package.json)
- [yaml-language-server](https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-yaml/blob/master/package.json)

> All of the configurations are sent to the Language Server, but only some of them
> are actually acted upon, but we don't which is which, yet.
